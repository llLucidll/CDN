**Why are you hosting all these images on a standalone GitHub repo??**


Hosting images on a GitHub repo lets me access the raw link from GitHub to the image uploaded.


This raw link uses GitHub's Content Delivery Network (CDN) to post the image. This means several of my web projects will be able to use CDN caching helping load assets quickly and reduce latency.
